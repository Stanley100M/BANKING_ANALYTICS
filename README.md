# BANKING ANALYTICS: TRENDS,RISKS, AND OPPORTUNITIES

## Project Overview

This project involves the analysis of a banking dataset to gain insights into customer behavior, financial activities, and the relationships between various features such as **income, savings, loans, and credit cards**. The dataset consists of customer attributes such as **age, nationality, occupation, income, risk weighting, and account types**, collected from a banking institution.

The analysis provides actionable insights into customer segmentation, financial trends, and risk analysis, showcasing skills in data wrangling, SQL queries, statistical analysis, and data visualization.

## Objective

The primary objectives of this project are:

* To explore and clean the banking dataset, identify trends and outliers.

* To segment customers into different categories based on their financial behavior.

* To identify correlations between variables like **income, credit card balance, bank loans, and risk weighting**.

* To analyze customer loyalty and lifetime value based on financial activity and account type.

* To visualize key metrics and insights, showcasing advanced data analysis and visualization skills

## Methodology

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

The dataset was initially loaded from a CSV file into an Oracle SQL database for efficient querying. 
The following preprocessing steps were undertaken:

* Removal of missing or erroneous values.

* Transformation of date fields into standard date formats for time-based analysis.

* Handling categorical variables like **gender, nationality, and loyalty classification** by encoding them into usable formats.

## SQL Queries and Analysis

All exploratory and analytical work in this project was primarily conducted using Oracle SQL. The queries were designed to replicate real-world banking analytics use cases, focusing on **customer behavior, financial health, product usage, and loyalty insights.**

The analysis can be broadly categorized into the following themes:

  ## 1. Customer Segmentation & Demographics
  **Business Questions Addressed**

     * Who are the bank’s customers?

     * How are customers distributed by age, income, occupation, nationality, and location?

  **Analyses Performed**

     * Customer distribution by age groups

     * Segmentation of customers into income tiers (Low / Middle / High)

     * Distribution of customers by location, nationality, and occupation

     * Total customer count per demographic segment
